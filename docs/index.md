Ideally you want to structure you python repository to look something like this. Let me explain role of
each folders and files.

```tree
docs/
<package_name>/
tests/
CHANGELOG.md
.gitignore
README.md
LICENSE.txt
setup.py
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
```

### docs

A general rule of thumb is to include all the documentation inside docs folder. You need to have four types of
documentation for your repository. 

- `Tutorials`: A set of tutorials for new users to use your code. This should be easy to understand and should self contained so user
can follow.
- `How to Guides`: Set of instructions for advanced user to use complicated utilities in your repo.
- `References`: Code documentation which can be autogenerated from your docstrings in the code.
- `Explanation`: Theoritical and/or philosophical explanation regarding design choices and assumptions made in your repo.
- `Guide to developers`" Set of instructions for contributors.
